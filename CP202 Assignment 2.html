  <p><strong>Mission:</strong></p>

  <p>The mission we are trying to provide with our website is to help inform and give inspiration to young women about fashion and beauty. This website will be designed to help young women express their beauty through new clothing trends, different make-up looks, and hair styles. The main goal we would like to achieve is to help young women feel beautiful both inside and out.</p>

  <p><strong>Target Audience:</strong></p>

  <p>The target audience we have chosen are young females within the ages of 15 to 22. The reason we are targeting this age group and specific demographic is because based on the research that we have found, we have come to the conclusion that this age group is most invested in beauty and fashion. </p> 
  
  <p> As proven in this website by Beth Shapouri <a href="https://www.racked.com/2016/5/26/11674106/buying-beauty-sephora-department"> (https://www.racked.com/2016/5/26/11674106/buying-beauty-sephora-department)</a> she has stated in her article that young women are the most interested in beauty as they are the largest consumers of the $13 billion cosmetic market. </p> 
  
  <p> In addition, this study by Experian demonstrates that this target audience is most interested in fashion trends and use fashion as a way to express themselves: <a href="http://www.experian.co.uk/assets/business-strategies/brochures/fashion_segments_handbook_females_small[1].pdf"> http://www.experian.co.uk/assets/business-strategies/brochures/fashion_segments_handbook_females_small[1].pdf</a>

  <p><strong>Content:</strong></p>

  <p> Our website is a beauty blog and we have three main contents we would like to focus on. First, we will create weekly posts on outfit ideas to keep up with the latest trends. These posts will include images of the outfit, links to purchase the clothing items, along with a small description on how we would style the clothing. Second, we will post weekly make-up trends, looks, and new cosmetic items. These will be posted with lots of images and links to purchase the products as well as tutorials. Lastly, we will post a weekly inspirational quote where our goal is to motivate and express to young women about their inner beauty. It will be positive and self-motivating for our users.</p> 
  <p> We will get this content from researching the latest fashion and beauty trends. When we find this content we will search for images online to show the trends and find clothing or cosmetic stores where our users can purchase the products. This will all be posted on our weekly beauty and fashion posts. As well, we would like personalize our blog by bringing in our own style so a lot of our content will come from our own interests. Such as the products we think are the best and what trends we think are popular. For our inspirational posts, we will also be creating these posts and writing about our own weekly motivation for our users to read. </p>

  <p><strong>Requirements Gathering Techniques:</strong></p>

  <p>We attend to gather our requirements by creating online surveys and setting up interviews 
  with young females. 
  With this we will become more informed of content that most interests our target audience. Therefore
  we will be able to keep our audience engaged and informed of the latest fashion trends that 
  most appeal to them. With our target audience being young females that consume a large amount of time
  on the internet, we believe online surveys will be a good technique to reach them. As
  mentioned earlier, young females invest a lot of time and money on the latest fashion trends, because 
  of that we believe setting up interviews with them will allow us to become more informed of their
  interests, and help us gather more specific content fulfilling their desires.</p>
